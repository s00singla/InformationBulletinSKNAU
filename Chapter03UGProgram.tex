		\item \textbf{Grade Point:} Numerical value denoting students' performance in a course. (which is usually the marks obtained divided by 10 and rounded off to one decimal point)
		\item \textbf{Credit Point:} Product of credit hours and grade point.
		\item \textbf{SGPA:} Semester Grade Point Average. It is the weighted average of credit points, credits been the weights.
		\item \textbf{OGPA:} Overall Grade Point Average, is numerical value obtained by student in all courses completed in all semesters for a degree programme. It is expressed as rounded to two decimals:
		\[
		OGPA = \frac{\sum (\text{Grade point} \times \text{Credit hrs})}{\sum (\text{Credit hrs})}
		\]
		\item \textbf{Year:} Academic session consisting of two semesters. 
		\item \textbf{Percentage:} For obtaining equivalent percentage of OGPA under 10 point scale, the OGPA will be multiplied by factor of 10. Academic session consisting of two semesters. 
		\item \textbf{Division:} The division of UG students shall be determined by the OGPA at the end of successful completion on programme which is as follows:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
				\hline
				\textbf{OGPA} & \textbf{Division} \\ \hline
				5.00–5.99 & II Division \\ \hline
				5.99–7.49 & I Division \\ \hline

	\section{ Examinations}
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\thesection.\arabic*.]
		\item The University shall conduct a main theory and/or practical examination at the end of each semester. Each exam is of two hours unless specified otherwise.
		\item Weightage: Courses with both theory and practical (viz. Cr.hrs 1+1,2+1,3+1) —70 marks (theory), 30 marks (practical). Courses with only theory or only practical (viz. Cr.hrs. 1+0, 2+0, 3+0, 4+0,  0+1,0+2) —100 marks.
		\item Grade point of a course = \(\text{Total marks obtained}\div{10}\). \\ Credit point = Grade point  \(\times\) Course credit.
		\item Distribution of marks for practical examinations (as per Notification No. SS/SKN/ 2023/3780, dated 17.05.2023):

		Attendance marks are allotted proportionately (e.g., up to 75\% = 0.5/2.0 marks; 95–100\% = 3.0/10.0 marks).
		\item The marks obtained in each subject (theory and practical separately) are converted into grade points on a 10-point scale. The minimum grade point required to pass a course shall be 5.00. The minimum grade point required to pass the course(s) in a semester shall be 5.00.
		\item The SGPA shall be calculated at the end of each semester by dividing the sum of the credit points earned by a student in all the courses during the semester by the sum of credit hours of those courses.
		\item A student shall be promoted to the next semester provided he/she secures a minimum SGPA of 4.50 in a semester and earns a minimum of 50\% of the total credit hours offered in that semester.
		\item A student failing to secure the minimum SGPA of 4.50 in a semester shall be placed on \textbf{academic probation} for the next semester. Such a student must improve his/her performance by earning at least 50\% of the credit hours offered in the subsequent semester with a SGPA of 5.00, failing which his/her name shall be removed from the rolls of the University.
		\item A student shall not be allowed to register in the next semester if he/she fails in more than 50\% of the courses offered in the previous semester.
