	\end{enumerate}
	
	The following illustrations shall make the mode of filling reserved seats clearer:
	
	\textbf{Illustration I:} If there are 8 seats reserved for the candidates of SC and the merit of the first two candidates in this category is such that it is higher than the merit of the last candidate getting admission against the General Category i.e. they are eligible to get admission against the General Category, still they will be given admission against the SC Category only and thus a total of 8 and not 10 SC candidates will get admission, as SC candidates.  
	
	\textbf{Illustration II:} If, however, against a quota of 8 seats reserved for SC candidates, the merit of the first 10 candidates in this category is such that it is higher than the last candidate getting admission against General Category, then the 9th and 10th SC candidates will get admission against General Category Seats.  
	
	\textbf{Illustration III:} If there are only 6 candidates who are successful in reserved category against the quota of 8 seats, then all the 6 (six) will be admitted in this category and the remaining 2 seats shall be transferred to the general quota.
