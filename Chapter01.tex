The lab is equipped with modern instruments and machinery such as a primary processing line, tray dryer, aloe vera gel extractor, pulper, and grinder, which enable students to learn different stages of raw material handling and product preparation. Equipment like the can sealing machine, bottle filling machine, and deep freezer help in packaging and storage studies, while analytical instruments such as the muffle furnace, centrifuge, and hot air oven support various quality and compositional analyses. Additionally, facilities like the fruit grader and autoclave aid in grading, sterilization, and hygienic processing practices.
This laboratory serves as a bridge between classroom learning and real-world applications, allowing students to develop technical skills relevant to post-harvest technology, processing, and value addition. Through hands-on training and experimentation, it encourages innovation and prepares students for professional roles in the horticulture and food processing sectors.
